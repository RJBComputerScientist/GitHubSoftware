FOR A NEW REACT NATIVE PROJECT AT 0.64.3 & 0.63.4 WITH EXPO ~44.0.2 (THIS WAS AT THE NEWEST SDK)
My steps that worked for me are:
1. expo init <NameOfProject>
2. Bare-minimum

	IOS:
1. Change what is in red and yellow yourself (depending on the package installers is a waste of time)
2. Add these line: 
File - AppDelegate.m

#if RCT_DEV
#import <React/RCTDevLoadingView.h>
#endif
//^^^ ADDED THIS

  #if RCT_DEV
  [bridge moduleForClass:[RCTDevLoadingView class]];
#endif
  RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge
                                                   moduleName:@"main"
                                            initialProperties:nil];
  //^^^ ADDED THIS (replace the other RCTRootView *rootView)

	ANDROID:
1. I oddly had to re do my path variables
2. Using a API 29 with Android 10 (Q) x86 for this laptop (re did the simulator and removed  android api 30)
3. Launched app in android studio and used a terminal for the metro server

	(^^^^ THIS WAS TO GET A BRAND NE PROJECT RUNNING ^^^^)
		FURTHER NOTES MAY BE APPLIED LATER
