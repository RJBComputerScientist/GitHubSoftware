- When making pages, i could either make them as files named as the page or a folder 
named as the page with a "index.js".
- the catch-all routes is used to get all parameters of the route, by doing "[...'name'].js
- REMEMBER using the anchor tags href attribute would reload the entire page.
- the "Link" component from "next/link" helps with fast refresh, keeping app state and pre-fetches data
when hovering over the link it self.
